Hello! I am Bridget! I am a twenty-year-old sophomore at the University of Washington. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **Informatics** with hopes of getting in the major. My goal out of college is to work in the music industry as a front-end developer.

As a fun fact about me, here are my favorite foods:

- french fries
- chicken strips
- oreo milkshake

# Lab Exercise
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `PROFILE.md`.

In this exercise, you will create a mini profile of yourself.

In your `PROFILE.md` document, format a title as header with your name as H1, University of Washington as H2, and your class standing as H3

Next, using command line, create a directory within your current directory called "photo", save a photo of yourself into this directory, and insert that photo using **relative path** into this report.

Then, write a little description about yourself with at least 2 different format stylings like **bold**, or *italicized*.

Next, rank your favorite foods in an **unordered** list.

Lastly, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.
