Hello! I am Bridget! I am a twenty-year-old sophomore at the University of Washington. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **Informatics** with hopes of getting in the major. My goal out of college is to work in the music industry as a front-end developer.

As a fun fact about me, here are my favorite foods:

- french fries
- chicken strips
- oreo milkshake
